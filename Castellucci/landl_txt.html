		<h2>Life & Lament
			<br/>2023, Belgrade
			</h2>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<p>
				The dialogue between life and death, unfolding through the work of Julija Castellucci,
is articulated in vocal expression, establishing communication with both living and
dead animals. This dialogue explores the boundaries of freedom for the beings that
lack the ability to express themselves in a language the humans use and are often
perceived as a lower species.<br/><br/>
Julija pays homage to the lives taken with a lament. Through the evolution of
consciousness and the genetic material, the human species finds itself in a position
where it doesn't have to consume animal meat, yet it continues, characteristic of
humanity, driven by greed or pleasure. Human and animal species coexist on this
planet, and human supremacy over other species placed animals in a position of
envy towards humans, subject to their mercy or cruelty.<br/><br/>
Through this reflection, Julija points out the complexity of the relationship between
humans and animals, challenging us to contemplate our relationship with other
species. Additionally, she raises questions about the morality, ethics, and
responsibility we have towards other living beings sharing our world. Is our
domination over other species justified? How should we define our relationship with
animals, and how do we treat them with respect and compassion?
