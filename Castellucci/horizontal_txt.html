			<p>H O R I Z O N T A L is a sonic long durational performance. This performance is concieved
to take place in an empty, precisely defined space. There, Julija, the performer, sings a
Japanese lullaby in a capella, while laying down horizontally on the ground. Underneath her
is placed a silver blanket, made out of a material that creates a micro sound.<br/><br/>
The contrapuntal theme in this performance is caused by the sounds in their fundamental
shape. Sounds of urban noise rumbling from outside into the background and the very flow of
the silver material interacting with the body that laying horizontally, including the micro
movements of the performer&#39;s body, as well as the ones from the visitor, who is invited to lay down next to her.
Throughout the entire performance, which lasts 3 hours, Julija is laying horizontally and
singing the Japanese lullaby a capella without stopping to each visitor individually. The
visitors enter the space one by one, and, as long as the lullaby lasts, the visitors have the
choice to go away or stay and lay down for a longer or shorter period of time.<br/><br/>
When one visitor leaves, another one comes in, and Julija starts to sing from the beginning
the same lullaby. Julija and the lullaby are constant, while the visitors change on average
every 5 minutes. For that time, through the frequencies produced by the body of Julija and
vocal apparatus, the visitors receive certain (sound) information. Information which is
contained in the Japanese Itsuki lullaby as it is.<br/><br/>
Visitors | Listeners have the opportunity to choose to which world they want to surrender:
vertical or horizontal or to stay somewhere in the middle of the intersection. In the centre of
their childlike innocence, or to allow themselves to fall upwards, vertically into the far
vicinity of the immaterial, the sound.
