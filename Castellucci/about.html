			Julija Castellucci is a conceptual and performance artist. She works in the field of
temporal and spatial art whose immersive approach includes sonic art | video | installation
| intervention in space in the form of sonic sculpture.Constantly incorporating specific
personal themes and motifs. Humour and satire are very present at Castellucci’s work, that
communicate to the public in verbal or written form. Her authenticity as a sonic sculpture
lies in the sophisticated vocal aesthetics, timbre and
frequency of the voice that makes the connection between primordial and contemporary
vocal expression. Aa a sonic sculpture she creates an abstract touching drawing in the
time and space in which she is. Julija was shortlisted to represent Serbia at the 60th
Venice Biennale in 2024 in collective with Sanja Latinović and Sonja Radaković with their
performative installation called | EMERGENCY EXIT | curated by Jovana Stokić.
Currently based in Belgrade.
