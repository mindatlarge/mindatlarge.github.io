							Hristina Susak (born 1996) has been composing since she was eight. At the age of seven she started playing violin and soon after that piano. Her early work is quite extensive and based on the style of past centuries. One of those compositions, „Prelude and Fugue“ for string orchestra (she wrote at the age of 15), was selected to be performed on the finalists concert of the 6th Competition for young Composers of Camerata Zürich in Kunsthaus Zürich (2013). Since she was 17, she has been searching and discovering new fields of sound and styles what allowed her to start finding her own style. - Her current work is based on combination of intuition and conceptual thinking; inspiration and strong structure.

From this point she continued with studies in music theory and composition at the same university. 2019 she graduated Music Theory with the master´s degree in the class of Prof. Gesine Schröder.
