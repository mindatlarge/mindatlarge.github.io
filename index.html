			<div id="prvi-par">&emsp;Born and raised in Barnsley, and in his youth an accomplished pianist, Tony Carter moved further north to begin his life as an artist: from 1962 to 1966 he was a student in fine art at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. This was the period when Hamilton was helping make Newcastle one of the most exciting places to study art. Engrossed in his reconstruction of Marcel Duchamp’s Large Glass, Hamilton used it as a vehicle for his teaching, in effect generously privileging students with insights into the sensibilities and minds of two pivotal artists. For Carter the experience was revelatory, proving a lasting influence in the development of his thinking. Among the students who shared this experience and who became lifelong friends were Stephen Buckley and Tim Head.</div></br>

			<div id="drugi-par">&emsp;Establishing himself in London (his small flat in Finsbury Park is remembered by Head as being a sort of ‘temple’) he found exposure for his work through exhibitions such as Young Contemporaries and the Serpentine Summer Show 3, but it was Anthony Stokes – first at Garage, and then at his eponymous gallery in Langley Court in Covent Garden – who brought Carter to wider notice. Although production was necessarily slow, given the exacting circumstances of its making, Carter’s sculpture and drawings featured in several group shows of the 1970s, the British Art Show among them, and in 1983 the Serpentine Gallery organised ‘Tony Carter – Images of subject-object duality 1968-82’. Recognition of the distinctiveness and significance of his art was probably most marked among his fellow artists, and it was around this time that Carter was recruited by Jon Thompson to join the distinguished group who pioneered the Goldsmith’s course. Carter’s work was included in the important 1986 exhibition ‘Falls the Shadow’ at the Hayward Gallery; there followed solo shows at Anthony Reynolds Gallery, in both Cowper Street and Dering Street. In 1990 Carter was appointed Henry Moore Artist Fellow at Kettle’s Yard and Christ’s College, Cambridge, and in 1994 he became a Fellow of the British School at Rome.</div></br>

			<div id="treci-par">&emsp;For much of his career Carter depended on teaching for his main source of income. As well as at Goldsmith’s, he taught for many years at Norwich School of Art and, for a period, until peremptorily laid off in a round of cuts, together with his wife, the artist Wendy Smith, he was an important inspirational presence at Camberwell. All this experience he brought to City and Guilds Art School where, having been previously head of fine art, he was appointed principal in 1998. For 16 years he devoted himself to securing the academic standing of the school and renewing its creative ambition, while always being sensitive to its special values and ethos; he is credited with having ‘refined, evolved and honed the core spirit’. At the same time as being principal, he continued as leader of the MA programme and brought to his teaching a broad sympathy allied to scrupulous care. Few tutors in an art school can have thought so long and so hard about what an art education should entail.</div></br>

			<div id="cetvrti-par">&emsp;Art, its meaning, its mysteries and epiphanies – its difficulties – absorbed most of Carter’s life. If always well turned out, usually in black or grey, his lifestyle (hardly the right word) was essentially frugal and austere. Yet, once a year he and Wendy would spend two weeks in a hotel in Wester Ross. They would dine well after walking most of the day. These were especially important times to him.</div></br>

			<div id="peti-par">&emsp;Always attracted to the vanitas theme in painting, he once exhibited at Anthony Reynolds Gallery a transcription of Hans Holbein’s Ambassadors. ‘My transcription’, he wrote, ‘is a declaration of faith; in the tradition of Art as tactile visual language, in a more holistic world view yet to come and, if we are lucky, in the power of imagination over death.’

				&emsp;It is a cliché to say that the Gulf War (and all other recent armed conflicts) have been fought as much on television as "on the ground". The view from the front room influenced the level of violence acceptable to our society and the extent to which the Allied general staff were prepared to sacrifice their soldiers. The collective memories that we have of that twentieth century crusade are almost all visual. The devastated air raid shelter in Baghdad, the burning oil wells, the ghastly incinerated face of an Iraqi tank driver or the precision computer graphics of the bombing raid are all responsible for determining how we arrive at a position on the achievements of the war, both collectively and individually.</br>&emsp;Sober analysis, however, will take place not in visual terms but via the written word. The books already being produced use images merely to illustrate their text, and in doing so remove the reader a further stage from the raw, emotional material of the conflict.</br>&emsp;This dependence on words to arrive at considered intellectual conclusions is symptomatic of a peculiar dichotomy in contemporary society. As we become increasingly visually literate — able to 'read' arcane advertisements or identify the televisual cliches upon which much comedy depends — we are also losing the collective ability to spend time with an image and allow it to stimulate our intellect and inform our opinions. To some extent the breadth of imagery now available has undermined its seriousness and cut us off from the sort of communication which medieval stained glass windows or seventeenth century Dutch still lifes offered to their contemporary societies.</br>&emsp;The work of Tony Carter challenges the superficial treatment of images. His sculptures ask the audience to look beyond the immediate signification of wine bottles or water canteens (amongst other every-day objects). In order to derive any value from his work we have to carry out an act of 'attentive looking', considering why these objects have been chosen and why they are placed in this configuration. Visiting a Carter exhibition becomes a dialogue between artwork and viewer which transforms the everyday into the symbolic, the commonplace into the representative and the particular into the universal.</br>&emsp;Carter's work is therefore often interpreted as difficult —in the sense that a demand is made upon the viewer which is not simply a puzzle to be solved. For looking at a work like American Dream does not resolve the debate about the rightness or wrongness of war. In fact we might leave this exhibition less certain than when we entered. The experience the work offers is more troubling than simply support or opposition for a predetermined political stance. Rather his work draws attention to the existence of alternatives, the (at least theoretical) possibility that the stars of the American flag could represent the cosmic order of the night sky rather than the dogmas of a particular nation. Our discomfort with such an idea stems perhaps from the tragedy of its impossibility in the present circumstances.</br>&emsp;Such a realisation might leave us with a feeling of hopelessness at the apparently intractable structures which limit our choices as a society. To move beyond this potentially destructive point, careful attention needs to be paid to the objects that make up the finished sculptures. The wine bottle and the water canteen exist also as bronze cast copies. Heavyweight and removed from any possible usefulness, they might initially appear as rather wasteful copies of the "real things". It is only as the effort of their production becomes apparent, involving as it does rigorous finishing by hand and careful control over the casting process, that their importance is revealed as precise acts symbolic of Carter's commitment to the metaphoric power of objects. The transformation from glass or tin to bronze involves the audience in a conceptual change in their relationship to the objects. They become not merely found utensils but specifically created objects that have been cared for and worried over. This highly concentrated attention to the mundane offers a possible model for patterns of human behaviour which might bring about the change in the symbolism of the American flag posed in American Dream/Arabian Night.</br>&emsp;Returning to the initial proposition of this introduction — that images are not readily seen as the way to communicate complex ideas in contemporary society — it is interesting to observe how Carter's work mirrors the written text in its use of a symbolic image-based language. The water and wine containers, flags and stars could be said to form the vocabulary, with the structure of black and white plinths, originals and bronze casts forming the grammar through which coherence is achieved, and small details such as the torches or ribbon acting as modifying adjectives. The intellectual rigour of the work is contained within this structure. However, Carter's work is not a replacement for text. Once the analogue of sculptural and grammatical structure is exhausted, there remain elements which do not make easy linguistic sense. The presence of an original canteen amongst its bronze casts and its naked opposite number on the other side of American Dream create an interruption in the ordered flow of the work. This disturbance opens out our responses, allowing the communication of ideas and parallels for which text would he structurally inappropriate. Looked at in this way, it is the dual nature of the sculptures which makes them rewarding for the viewer. Intellectual and emotional content are present at the same moment and this tension creates the space for emotional or xsthetic responses while maintaining a vital connection with immediate social concerns.

				&emsp;In 1979, Tony Carter embarked upon a work which was to take him the best part of three years of meticulous work to complete. It comprised the systematic re-working of a newspaper photograph, the subject of which was a group of Bangladeshi refugees fleeing the advance of the Indian army. Methodologi-cally speaking, the project was a straightforward one. Each half-tone dot was to be replaced by a paint mark of a corresponding size and intensity, thus obliterating and re-stating each tiny fragment of the image at one and the same time. The ground rules were also simple. There was to be no deliberate intensification in the course of this mark-making and no forcing of the image as a whole. The integrity of the process was to be sacrosanct and the signific-ance of its outcome taken on trust.</br>&emsp;Just three months into this exacting, even punishing programme of work, Carter was already aware of a most disturbing transformation at work in the completed section of the image. Far from merely replicating the orderly pattern of mechanical dots which together formed the original press photo-graph, the refurbishing marks seemed possessed by a sinister inner life, a life which was at once both organic in feel and self-replicating in character. It was as though a mutation had occurred in the close cellular structure of the image, forcing a new and malignant order into being. Carter himself, speaking at the time, would often describe it as a cancerous growth and himself as the agent of its relentless spread and the author of its pathology. What had started inno-cently as a neatly packaged and conceptually tight process work - not too dissimilar to several works which Carter had completed in the previous five or six years - had transformed itself into a site of profound psychological and creative struggle.</br>&emsp;The nature of this struggle is captured succinctly by the title which he gave to this work on its completion in 1982: Virus - of Wor and Subjective Seeing. The sense of one thing here metaphorised as a virus - invading,
				occupying and finally taking over another, is inescapable. For Carter, then, the enemy is within - almost one might say in the blood - transforming the body, the human subject, into a corpse filled with subjective cravings; and it is this compelling subjectivity which both distorts and ornaments our apprehension of the objective world. The analogy he draws is a telling one. Just as the socially corrosive effects of war persist in the fabric of society long after the fighting and skirmishing has stopped, so the subjective eye continuously weakens our grasp on objective truth.</br>&emsp;At first sight, Carter's message would seem to be a bleak one. Certainly it functions as a stern reminder of the inherent duality of human thought. If it is true that immediate reality cannot be known, excepting perhaps dimly, through the dark glass of human subjectivity, then what price the values we derive from our experience, what price human judgement? Is not the whole humanistic enterprise continuously and absolutely in jeopardy?</br>&emsp;Carter, like Eliot before him, finds some respite from the apocalyptic nature of this question in contemplating the purpose and function of creative work. Starting with what, in the first instance, is an objective material process, the artist undertakes a journey along a path which passes from the external to the internal world and back again. In the course of this journey the work of art is inflected subjectively but its ultimate destination remains the same. It must attain the status of object and stand alongside all other objects in the world. It must be undeniably real. Where it will be manifestly different is in the quality of its presence. A transfiguration will have occurred, doubling the object as subject.</br>&emsp;In the early work - of which Virus - of War and Subjective Seeing might be taken as a key example - Carter demonstrated this doubling through a strategy of reiteration. The chosen object was quite literally made again -dressed - in its own image. More recently he has chosen to use analogy as a means of extending the subjective reading of the object. One analogy is piled upon another, creating a penumbra of closely woven, often enigmatic, visual references. This process is first engaged through a common-or-garden object, something which has its point of origin in contemporary utility: a press photo-graph; a travelling clock; a tin can; a sash-cramp; a Mag lamp; a wrist watch; a pair of binoculars. And the initial attraction is crucial if he is to sustain the quality of attention necessary to carry the object through into its new and transfigured life. Carter describes this as a powerful feeling of connectedness, in which some aspect of mind or physical body is suddenly and dramatically metaphorised.</br>&emsp;
				The progress of a work, then, begins with a material or phenomenal coin-cidence linking the sensual, corporeal self with something in the outside world. It proceeds via a kind of inner reverie - the self observing the self; the self as subject and the self as object - which serves to expand the original metaphor, allowing it to embrace even the grandest of metaphysical questions without loss ofpotency. In the work titled Drum, for instance, Carter recognized in the relentless ticking of a clock and in the constricting strap of a wristwatch a metaphor for body-pressure - pulse and heartbeat - and this led him to a lengthy contemplation of temporality; birth and death; mortality and immor-tality. In the twin works, Excalibur (1 & 2), the initiating object, the sash-cramp, its power to compress, hold and release - presented itself as a more or less precise metaphor through which to address, in an extended way, the question of human pain. The sash-cramp, subjectively doubling as an unsheathed sword, is made to speak of raw exposure and bodily solitude: to stand for the human subject, trapped and held by an unrelenting barrage of sensations.</br>&emsp;This, the inward, reflective stage in the development of a work, is Carter's way of shaking things loose from the ties which bind them to the language of common usage, of setting them apart from their utility. The first step is to seize and be seized by a metaphor, but this is only the beginning. What starts as a metaphor, with all the distancing that metaphor implies, must, in the final emergence of the work, result in a complete transformation of the object: the Mag lamp must, in a very special way, become the eye of the sun; the strip of pink veined marble must be made again as the rarefied, timorous body. As objects things can remain themselves, but as subjects they must reach beyond metaphor to attain a different nature.</br>&esmp;Buried deep in Carter's work, then, is a root and branch attack on the inflexibility of instrumental language. As far as he is concerned, names are a poor substitute for things, and the act of naming, one sure way of consigning things to a kind of imaginal oblivion; to a place which is both out of sight and out of mind. Names too, consort with syntactic and grammatical rules to form a model of the world which is dangerously limited by brute fact. In the largest and most ambitious of his recent works, Particle, Mind and Void, a homage to Niels Bohr the eminent philosopher and scientist who died in 1962, this critical dimension emerges as the central linking theme of the work. It was Bohr who succeeded in de-stabilizing the model of post-Newtonian physics by rein-vesting scientific thought and language with a subjective, metaphoric life, and it is this aspect of Bohr's achievement which, in Carter's eyes, makes him worthy of celebration.</br>&esmp;
				This large and complex work, Particle, Mind and Void, has its starting point in the coat-of-arms printed on the title page of a book published in 1967 to commemorate Bohr's life and work. This heraldic device - a flattened ovoid form - reminded Carter of a brand label of the kind which is used on tinned food and it was this notion of labelling -seeing it as a form of dress, a uniform - which led him to what he calls the 'dressed can' as a suitable metaphor for a constituent particle. Out of this conceptual invention there flowed a number of more fugitive analogies, one of which proved to be crucial. He discovered that when lit from a certain angle the can produced an halation of light, similar in shape to Bohr's coat-of-arms but shot through horizontally by an ellipse of light; the whole configuration being reminiscent of a gyroscope. It was an important moment. The 'dressed can', doubling as a particle, had yielded up a subsidiary metaphor for the precarious stability which characterizes the natural order of things. More than this. By passing from the domain of the readable into the world of phenomena, it had served to open up a space in which, by the accretion and circulation of visual connections, the work could grow atomically, taking on its own life.</br>&esmp;Carter's distrust of language, then, is largely directed at its phenomenal passivity. For him the word is confined to its own universe of expression by its own rules and its own history of usage. The assumption, fashionable at the moment, that words constitute one system of signs amongst many, and that these systems are easily interchangeable, for him, is given the lie by paying close attention to the visual nature of things. Seeing is a real transaction taking place in a real world, and while subjective seeing distorts and ornaments - partly obscures - our view of reality, the doubling it produces is at least made tangible in the senses. In this respect it is perhaps more trustworthy than written language.</br></br></br></br>

				&emsp;"There is no escape from matter. There is no escape from the physical nor is there any escape from the mind. The two are in constant collision course. You might say that my work is like an artistic disaster. It is a quiet catastrophe of mind and matter."</br>
				&emsp;Robert Smithson, 1969.</br></br>
				&emsp;Smithson's description of his art as caught up in a `constant collision' between 'mind' and 'matter' could well apply to recent work by Tony Carter. It would of course be necessary to qualify Smithson's self-destructive fascination with extreme contradiction, as well as the expectation of revolutionary change that characterised so much radical culture of the 1960s. To conceive of human consciousness' interaction with the material world as 'a quiet catastrophe of mind and matter' was for him part of a larger political project to expose the violent tensions at work behind the bland facade of modern capitalism.</br>&emsp;Negotiating the wreckage of many of those collective ideals that gave Smithson's project its libertarian thrust, we may now wish to recuperate a more explicit humanitarian dimension from art. It might seem too close to a counsel of despair to view in such starkly nihilistic terms the insistent disjunctions that mark modern art — between mind and matter, freedom and necessity, the transfigured and the commonplace, the integrity of the individual thing and the homogenising effects of commodification. But we still have to confront these dualities, which are as unavoidable for art as they are for any other aspect of contemporary society.</br>&emsp;An interesting art such as Tony Carter's confronts these dualities as a necessary condition for its existence and does not pretend to resolve it. . His work faces us squarely with the disparity between thoughts and things. In three dimensional work, this "collision' can be enacted more literally than in other forms of visual art. Certainly more so than painting, which by definition seeks to mediate between the materiality of things and the relative immateriality of two dimensional representation.</br>&emsp;What are the these "things" in Tony Carter's work —the wine bottles, the mag lamps, the metal canteens? Are they found objects, mere triggers for a projective fantasy that dematerialises them into signs and makes their mute materiality meaningful? Carter's work does not operate within the hands off neo-Dada ethos that dominates the more avant garde contemporary sculpture. His is a bodied, rather than a disembodied art, one fixated on the physicality of things and the processes of fabrication. He cannot leave his found objects alone. They are drawn into an obsessive, often excessive, process of remaking and surface transformation. The shiny tin canteens, partially wrapped in cheap material, are cast as bronze replicas whose dull green, patinated, finely rendered surfaces both reproduce and refine upon their originals. The black mag lamps are denuded of their anodized protective covering to become gleaming, silvery metal objects. The wine bottles are cleansed of their labels and emptied of their contents to become pure, translucent glass and then remade into shining bronze.</br>&emsp;No one could deny the conceptual and metaphorical complexity of all Carter's work, though recently it has become less explicitly literary and more concerned with the materiality of things. In American Dream, one of his more ambitious pieces to date, things are clearly being presented as focuses of thought and psychic investment. The viewer is invited to contemplate and explore the work by pursuing associations triggered off by the juxtaposition of its different elements.</br>&emsp;On one side are bottles filled with wine/blood, on the other empty translucent glass after-images; on one side, tin canteens blanketed in a red, white and blue patterned fabric, on the other, darker bronze replicas where the protective covering has been obliterated; on one side the bodied, on the other the spectral, the lifeless. A polished bronze sheet in the middle divides the world of the living from that of the dead, reflecting back to each the slightly blurred, ghostly image of itself. The cheap glitz of the `American dream' is set against the horror of war and death it brings in its wake. Yet the work also suggests the transfigurative power of violence. A power which upholds the vilest of patriotic myths and American dreams which were played out recently in the Persian Gulf with the annihilation of upwards of 200,000 foreign lives.</br>&emsp;The canteens suggest ideas of thirst in the desert, making more insistent the apparently contingent connection between this work and the events of the war during which it was fashioned. As objects, the canteens double as liquid containers and cased voids; seen as metaphorical bodies, particularly in cast bronze form, the dark openings in their necks suggest gaping wounds. The emptying of the wine bottles on the spectral side of the work and the removal of the black protective layer on the mag lamp imply destruction. At the same time these ordinary objects are converted into things of a clearer, more light-filled aspect. A similar dialectic of death and transfiguration is suggested by the transformation of the canteens into their bronze double. Denuded of their tinny gloss and coloured covers they become more precious and conventionally beautiful. The casting process metaphorically burns them out and transfigures them.</br>&emsp;But what is there to make the metaphoric play necessary, beyond the titles and a teasing juxtaposition of seemingly disparate objects inviting us to puzzle out the conceptual logic that might tie them together? An array of objects, however unusual or curious cannot of itself offer a guarantee of meaning. Meaning insinuates itself once the presence of the objects and the configurations they form become an obsession, prompting the projection of fantasy and association as unconscious necessity. Only when irrational appetites and psychic investment latch onto a thing is the mind prompted compulsively to play with the possibilities of meaning it might have.</br>&emsp;There are two different ways in which a visible obsession is manifested in Tony Carter's insistently paradoxical manipulation of objects. One involves working over an object and remaking it so it is simultaneously totally transformed and preserved in its integrity. The second entails arranging the objects within a tight abstract pattern that both constitutes them as a formal unity and marks them out as discrete independent things. The first, the transformation of 'found' objects, brings to mind Borges' story about a modern symbolist poet who sought to reconstitute Cervantes' Don Quixote as an original modern creation by reproducing it word for word.</br>&emsp;In Carter's reworking of objects, they are both copied "word for word" and materially transfigured, either 12 
				through replicating and recreating them as a bronze ) cast or by working on the object itself and depatinating or repatinating its surface. In both cases the surface form remains the same while its substance becomes totally changed. The object is remade according to the artist's fantasy, while the artist's fantasy is submitted unreservedly to the integrity of the object's shape. In this context, the idea of freely recreating and materially transfiguring commonplace things is as appropriate, and as inappropriate, as that of scrupulously copying them and remaining true to their predetermined aspect.</br>&emsp;Such a paradox illuminates, in a very vivid way, the incompatible imperatives of a compelling art as something both free and necessary. We are with Tony Carter's work neither in a fashionable world of Pop coolness and witty re-presentation of the objects of consumer culture, nor in a more old-fashioned Romantic world of resonant symbolic projection and pathetic fallacy. It is, rather, a conceptually and visually frustrating world that allows no easy resolutions and achieves its imaginative resonances through a relentless playing out of awkward paradoxes -like the world of Borges' labyrinths, both very ancient and very modern.</br>&emsp;If Tony Carter's objects are conceived as elements in a highly articulated thought process - not so much objects of thought as a landscape of thinking - they are nevertheless very consciously caught up in the thought-denying imperatives of commodification. There is no evasion of the banality conferred on objects as they are absorbed within the formal value structures of the consumer society; just as there is no evasion of the more tawdry and disturbing myths of heroic death and stars and stripes jingoism in American Dream and American Dream/Arabian Night.</br>&emsp;If we take the canteen, the object that plays a particularly central role in this new series of works, we are presented at one level with nothing more than a common tin container, cheaply decked out with a colourful covering to give it a gift shop allure. It is both strictly functional but also possessed of a tacky visual appeal irrelevant to its function. We have here then an exemplary commodity, displayed in a gallery as it would be in a shopping market. It becomes an object of exchange or consumption, quite removed from its use value. At this level, we are forced to confront the meaninglessness of things as they are trained in consumer culture. The cheap metal canteens would seem to frustrate the desire to project a substantial significance on things, beyond the prefabricated, banal aura of commodification.</br>&emsp;Even "mere" commodities, however, work on us by invoking and fetishising desires that have nothing to do with the usefulness or material substance of the things. It is with such desires that the meaning of Tony Carter's work begins as well as the metaphorical freedom that such bracketing out of use value allows. The practical function of the canteens as containers or the mag lamps as sources of artificial light is erased, both in the processes of formalisation that constitute them as art (processes that run parallel to the formalisations of commodification) and in the generalised eroticisation of the form of things that occurs once they become objects of consumption. The canteen in Desert, suspended against a six foot panel at crotch level with a glass bead dangling from its stopper, could be fantasised as an image of the very fount of desire, an ambiguous sexual organ, violating projection and violated opening. Bottles become bodies holding or spilling "warm" blood/wine.</br>&emsp;The excess of appetite generated in the frustrated encounter with ordinary things, transformed into objects of desire through their status as commodities, invests them with a bodily presence. In the same way, as if it were part of the same flow of libidinal discharge, thought invests these things with meanings and resonances of a life and death duality. Yet we also unavoidably draw ourselves up short, and see them in their literal materiality as meaningless and inert, or as the mere fetishes they "really" are.</br>&emsp;"Things" are both dumb commodities and highly charged talismans, whose significance is contingent, uncontrollable, emanating from the unconscious. Living within modern consumer culture, we are constantly confronted with this contradictory value of material things. They face us as if nothing mediated between their radically disparate identities as one dimensional commodities and resonant things. They both frustrate and incite our desires and imaginative faculties. They are both alienatingly banal and supremely significant. No definitive 
				choice can he made between these radically disparate alternatives, one condition constantly interrupts the ocher.</br>&emsp;The logic of commodification is also played out in the disarticulation between the overall arrangement of the pieces and their component parts. In each case, there is a purely abstract pattern, based on simple principles of symmetry and linear alignment, that holds together the discrete objects forming the body of the work but does not impinge upon their character, or integrate them into an articulated whole. The overall formal structure — the composition to talk in traditional pictorial terms — and the elements that compose it exist at quite separate levels, in the same was that the grid of commodification has nothing to do with the substance of the "things in themselves". Exchange value inside the grid is quite other than usefulness in the material world.</br>&emsp;To recast this in terms of the formal principles of minimalist art, there needs to be systematic denial of traditional composition and of the integrated whole within which the identity of the component parts would he rearticulated. Instead we have a simple arrangement of elements whose integrity, or character, remains unaffected by the arranging structure. There is nothing to mediate between the formal pattern of the whole and the atomised individual elements composing it. As we might say of modern capitalism, a radical disparity exists between two different conceptions of things and structures: on the one hand there is no society only individuals, on the other a social aggregate whose form has nothing to do with individual identity; on one hand particular workers and consumers, on the other the totally impersonal, structural logic of the market.</br>&emsp;An interesting art can hardly evade the pervasive disjunction between the individual and the collective that allows modern capitalism to function, but it can resist the dominant effects of this disjuncture. It can offer the flawed promise of a reconceptualised and significant assemblage of things driven by the projective power of mind and imagination, rather than by the empty, formal logic of commodification. Tony Carter's "compositions" are poised between the disjunctive assemblages of minimalism, and the imaginative integration that is promised, but never quite convincingly delivered, by the ideal of integrated 
				wpictorial composition.</br>&emsp;In American Dream the whole is a simple geometric structure - a line of equally spaced elements, cut in the middle by a bronze plane set perpendicular to it, a formal totality that does not shift the atomised significance of the individual, constituent objects. At the same ime, the bronze plane in the centre reflects b wack each half ro as in a picture, making a pictorial whole of an aggregate of objects. But this pictorial composition is only one very partial, incomplete view - occluded, what is more, by the blurring effect of the surface of the metal plate. The reflected picture, which promises to integrate all the elements of the work in a unified field, is not only just half a picture. It is infinitely variable, at any instant presenting but one possible image among many.</br>&emsp;American Dream/Arabian Night is perhaps more conventional in its presentation - more pictorial and closer to still life painting. In this sense it is a little more like some of Tony Carter's earlier work from the 1960's and 1970's. It is conceived as a theatrical composition, with a painted panel functioning as a back drop to the row of bottles and canteens ranged before it like actors on a stage. The way the line of bottles seems to press inward towards the centre and burst out towards the spectator enhances the effect of a conventional pictorial composition. But even here there is no comfortable integration. Two slightly disjunct pictorial fields vie with one another, one the backdrop panel, where stars are scattered randomly over a flattened virtual sky; the other the shallow stage before the panel where the solidity of objects asserts itself. The shallow stage area refuses to collapse into a picture and can never satisfactorily be integrated with the sky above and behind it. The objects on the stage are too insistently embodied to be identified with the dematerialised stars above; formally and physically they remain radically different entities. The equivalence of the elements in the two fields holds only as a pure mental construct that can never be located in the work.</br>&emsp;These works by Tony Carter are intricate and complex - yet made out of easily recognisable "ordinary" things arranged in simple patterns. There is something uncomplicated, direct and very unprecious about their conception. Yet there is too a visible excess in the care
				ith which they are presented. The objects and patterns they make are taken so intensely seriously, so worried over, so carefully worked and tuned. A teasing disjunction exists between the ordinariness of the component elements and compositional patterning on the one hand, and the refinement of execution and subtlety of juxtaposition on the other. This in turn invites a gratuitously excessive investment on the part of the spectator. The thought processes that are triggered are somewhere between day dreaming and rigorous analysis, between a submission to fascination with the material form of simple things, and a more abstract process of transforming these into signs and mental constructs. We are here in the world of radically democratic intellectual activity conjured up so well in Borges' Don Quixote story: 
				</br></br>&emsp;Thinking, analysing, inventing . . . are not anomalous acts; they are the normal aspirations of the intellect. To glorify the occasional performance of that function. is to confess our laziness or our barbarity.</br></br>
				&emsp;Such desire to break down the hierarchies of value that are "barbarically" asserted while ostensibly being denied within modern consumer culture, goes very much against the grain of the merely formal equalities that this culture tries to claim for itself. The best art does not effect a separation between the paradoxical, the contradictory, the difficult, and day to day material things and appetites. Its conceptual transfigurations never take us away from the mute ordinariness of "mere" objects; its gratuitous obsessions and imaginative projections are always located in the "foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart".
