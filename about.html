			<h1>Expressions of age and ageing in the human face – signs & symbols</h1>

			<h1>The Art of Jelena Bulajić</h1>
			<div class="text1">
			<p>
			One of Art’s more complex but superficially straightforward projects integral to the post-Renaissance legacy in Europe is that which purports to represent the appearance of things in the name of ‘realism’. In its most extreme forms this convention seems to assume that any material thing is reducible to an absolute of appearance and although that would not in itself be thought to represent all that constitutes an object’s reality it would be thought to define its exterior aspect from a particular view-point and in that sense to represent the ‘face’ of that reality. However, the German philosopher Martin Heidegger wrote compellingly on what he called the ‘thingness’ of the thing and in doing so disclosed through his own form of poeticised logic the inescapable presence of the human subject – ie the observer rather than the observed – informing all our attempts both to understand the nature of Reality in all its philosophical implications and our best efforts to re-present this in material forms. Appearance and reality, and the varying degrees either of their mutual integrity or their discontinuity are arguably crucial to all our negotiations with the world as we find it and, given that we are both social beings by necessity and subjective creatures in our private lives, their relationship can never be more important than in our dealings with others of our kind, whatever their race, status, gender; or their age.<br/><br/>
			Jelena Bulajic is a ‘portrait painter’, or to put it more accurately, at this stage in her career she chooses to represent the process of ageing as it finds expression in the human face. She does this with consummate skills and with great faithfulness to the factual evidence she accumulates with the aid of a high-spec. digital camera. Of such a project, we might wonder what could be so exclusively fascinating about old age that is not in some way gratuitous. If we by-pass the implications of human vanity and its contemporary interest in cosmetic interventions we find our way readily to answers of a generic kind, most of which are built on the familiar concept of a mind/body duality. In the bio-medical model this might also extend to the physiological/neurological; in Judeo Christian tradition to body and soul. The prevailing values of a materialistic and essentially secular society may incline us away from notions of the Soul at least at a conscious level, but with or without the context of Faith, the word is probably as near in its intended significations as we can get to what would identify an individuated life-force continuous and undiminished by the ravages of time on the exterior body. One might almost think of this as forbidden territory, so susceptible is it to classification in the realm of the mystical, and yet Bulajic dares to enter there, trusting her fastidious intelligence and the precision of her skills to keep the integrity of her end-product sacrosanct within the limits of what can be seen, and free from gratuitous effect.<br/><br/>
			Behind the façade of age was youth; on the near horizon before it, death waits – unavoidable, implacable. That thought might be the most concise referent informing the psychological position from which Jelena Bulajic chooses both to contemplate and to represent her subjects, though it provides not so much a model for action as a psychological constraint, enabling consistency in her critical judgement and the preserving of emotional equilibrium. Despite the apparent inflexibility of her photographic evidence the work’s progress towards resolution is to a considerable extent empirical in its adaptions of that material, though within the confines of certain noticeable conditions and priorities; these are evident as:<br/><br/></p></div>
			<div class="text1 uvuci">
			<p>
			•	a frequent but not exclusive adoption of very large scale format.<br/>
			•	a more or less palpable resonance achieved between the standing structure of the face and the ‘spread’ 		of the character ‘behind’ it.<br/>
			•	a sustained feeling of compassion leavening a dispassionate process.<br/>
			•   a strong inclination towards a shallow pictorial space, and skin tonalities closely coinciding with a 		background that is usually blank.<br/>
			•	a use of pigments which are unconventional, including carbon and marble dust in medium. (the 		‘paintings’ shift unselfconsciously between the means and media of drawing and painting)<br/>
			•	a practice within which the artist works not to a client’s brief but to her own commissioning of 		subjects. <br/>
			•	a selective use or evocation of the ‘vanitas’ genre.<br/><br/></p></div>
			<div class="text1">
			<p>
			From these choices devolve the strategies and, ultimately, the creative substance of Bulajic’s achievement. Pre-eminent among the work’s characteristics is a continuous allusion to the fugitive nature of human life; the pallor for the most part of skin colour and tonality – veering toward transparency – and its apparent absorption into the blank, almost identical colouration of the grounds evidently supports this. In the particularly powerful portrait of Alise Lange, the dissolution in progress is at its most graphic in the ‘blaze’ of white hair discharging as it seems the body’s vital energy into the void. The force with which it seems to do even this speaks of past glory in the vitality of its corporeal state and, as with all Bulajic’s paintings of the last four years leaves behind in the face, the legacy of lived experience, ‘encrypted’ in the mesh of lines that record the sheer emotional and physical effort of life’s resistance to the pull of gravity; depending on how we see or think, it either destroys beauty or confers gravitas. Jelena loves the lines and examines their calligraphy with the appetite of an etymologist pledged to deciphering a lost language; the lines that are deeply grooved are followed to their source and through their ‘tributaries’ – at that point she finds lines that are impending rather than obvious! but still part of the ‘vocabulary’.  <br/><br/>
			Characteristic of the portraits of women in care-homes (2010-12) is a degree of recourse to the conventions of ‘vanitas’ as a way of contextualising life both in the close proximity of death itself and in its ‘municipal’ ante-chamber. What could be categorised as prosthetic extensions are represented with a weight of material insistence that only heightens the poignancy of their human counterparts who will, evidently, be outlasted by the paraphernalia of material and moral support, ie spectacles, hearing-aids, soft-toy comfort objects etc. These are embellished by intensities of colour that have drained away from the primary human subjects. The ‘object’ in one particular case demonstrates degrees of suppleness and tensile strength that are no longer available to ‘Alise Lange’ (the subject and the patient) but they are made visible in the sinuous red attachment to her hearing aid – disturbingly suggestive of an exposed part of the vascular system and otherwise allusive to those surgical interventions where the interior body is laid bare; it is a reminder of the extent to which the dialogue maintained by old age with its organic functions – their waywardness and unreliability, the processes of their servicing – will be both a leitmotif of daily life and a periodic affront to human dignity. But Bulajic’s aims are not, I think, to be political or didactic; she is deeply thoughtful and acute in her observations and she represents these objects because they are such intimate appendages of the bodies concerned and no doubt benign in so far as they sharpen the senses and, presumably, enhance the ruminative life! The metaphoric allusions are never contrived, nor self-conscious, but the product of meticulous observation and an instinct for where the metaphors might be that invoke the dialogue between appearance and all beyond it that combines to substantiate its reality.  <br/><br/>
			Of a different order is the assertive choice to monumentalise these socially marginal figures to a vertical canvas height of around 2.5 metres. There is in this decision a conscious need for conformity between the depictive project and the exploration of a metaphorical ‘terrain’ in which, to a carefully calculated degree, the artist can ‘lose’ herself in the detail and, as it were, slacken the umbilical link to the photographic evidence with which she begins. On this grand scale the extended surface takes-on almost geological connotations and these are reinforced by the processes and materials which are variously ‘washed’ over or abrading its skin. The terminology used is informative to the extent – for example – that when charcoal is used, the surface area where it is present is described (by the artist) as high in ‘carbon deposits’ which distinguish it from other strata where stone-dust may be preponderant. The consequences of this effectual loss of bearings are significant in distinguishing Bulajic’s project from some of the apparent precedents that spring to mind – the work of American artist Chuck Close for example, but whose work is immediately and radically different in its retention of digital structures. Bulajic’s initial research does indeed use a digital camera to provide basic information and to anchor the image sufficiently in the realm of conventional reality, but from then on her search is for the essential character behind the standing structure of the face and that has to be discovered in the space she makes for manoeuvre.<br/> <br/>
			The consummation of this effort requires two ‘images’ to come into closest alignment, but which can never completely overlap. The most obvious of these is what I’ve called the ‘standing structure’ which is a depiction limited to the moment – a cypher to identify the social-being. The other has to be, by comparison, an account of character as ‘seen’ by the artist’s subjective  eye within a broader biographical landscape where things past are never lost; if this empathic effort can evoke a sufficiently persuasive presence in the painting it will be the distillation of all we have ever meant by words such as essence or ‘soul’. The relative transparency of the surfaces of these paintings which still retain an extraordinarily detailed account of the material facts is, stylistically, Jelena Bulajic’s invention – a means of making this different and subtle reality continuous with, but of its nature bigger than the standing structure. The proposition might stretch credulity and as an aim might seem to attempt the impossible, but the results are profound, provocative and deeply moving. <br/><br/><br/>
